#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures reliability, security, reduces cost and time and efficiency in software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 – Software Engineering Defined
Coined at a NATO conference to solve the software crisis with structured development.
1980s-1990s – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Introduced modularity and reusability with languages like C++ and Java.
2000s-Present – Agile & DevOps
Enabled faster, iterative development and automated deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project goals, scope, and resources.
Requirement Analysis – Gather and document user needs.
Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX plans.
Implementation – Write and develop the actual code.
Testing – Identify and fix bugs for quality assurance.
Deployment – Release software for user access.
Maintenance – Update and improve the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a sequential approach, where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements, such as building a hospital management system.
Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous improvements through small, frequent releases. It is ideal for fast-changing projects, like developing a mobile app that evolves with user feedback.
Waterfall Example: Building a hospital management system where requirements are clear from the start.
Agile Example: Developing a mobile app with evolving user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Writes, tests, and maintains code based on project requirements.
Collaborates with designers and analysts to implement features.
Debugs and optimizes software for performance and efficiency.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Designs and executes test cases to identify bugs and issues.
Ensures software meets quality standards before release.
Works with developers to improve software reliability and security.
Project Manager
Oversees project planning, timelines, and resource allocation.
Coordinates team efforts and ensures deadlines are met.
Communicates with stakeholders to align project goals and progress.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) improve productivity by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. They enhance coding efficiency, error detection, and automation. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes, enable collaboration, and prevent data loss. They allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing – Verifies that different modules work together as expected.
System Testing – Evaluates the entire system’s functionality and performance.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user requirements before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to optimize AI model responses. It involves structuring queries to guide AI behavior, ensuring accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.
Importance:
Improves Response Accuracy – Well-designed prompts yield precise and useful answers.
Enhances AI Efficiency – Reduces the need for multiple refinements.
Customizes AI Behavior – Tailors responses for specific use cases like coding, writing, or analysis.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, including examples of its applications."
